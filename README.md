## 🎯 The Core Philosophy: Stateless Security

Traditional password managers rely on a **central vault**. This vault, even when encrypted, is a single point of failure and a high-value target for hackers. A breach at the company level could expose the encrypted passwords of millions of users.

**CryptoPass eliminates this risk entirely.** It is a **stateless** application, meaning it has **no vault**. It doesn't store your generated passwords anywhere—not on your device, not in the cloud.

So, how does it work?

It uses a powerful and deterministic cryptographic formula. Think of it as a perfect, secret calculator that only you know how to operate.

| Input Element | Icon | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Master Passphrase** | 🤫 | Your primary secret. The only thing you ever need to remember. It's the master key to your digital life. |
| **Domain** | 🌐 | The website you're visiting (e.g., `google.com`). |
| **Username** | 👤 | (Optional) Your email or username for that specific site. |
| **OTOP** | 🔢 | A 4-digit "One-Time OTOP" you create on the spot for added session uniqueness. |

These inputs are fed into the CryptoPass engine, which uses them to generate a unique, complex, and completely predictable password. Use the same inputs tomorrow, and you'll get the exact same password back.

## 🚀 Getting Started Guide

### **Step 1️⃣: Installation**
*   Download and install the extension from the official **[Chrome Web Store]([LINK_TO_YOUR_CHROME_WEB_STORE_PAGE])**.

### **Step 2️⃣: Your Master Passphrase**
*   Open the extension. The first and most important step is to choose your Master Passphrase.
*   **⚠️ CRITICAL:** This phrase is the key to everything. It cannot be recovered if you forget it. Write it down and store it in a safe, physical location (like a safe or a bank vault).

### **Step 3️⃣: Generate Your First Password**
*   With the extension open, fill in the fields:
